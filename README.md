## Python

Originally learned java, but a lot of my applications I wanted to make were a lot easier to create in Python.
So I decided to make the full switch to Python as I feel like it is more utilized in creating programs.
It is also useful for leetcoding as I have to write less syntax, which means I can spend more time learning different topics.
